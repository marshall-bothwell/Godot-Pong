<p>The first moment in the game that left an impact on me was the appearance of the spider. The spider is the first living thing the player encounters. The player first encounters the spider as an obstacle in a puzzle, where only the spider's legs are visible. Before reaching the spider, the world of Limbo seems empty and devoid of life. After encountering the spider, the player sees it crawl away, foreshadowing its return. Freud states that “’Fright, ‘fear’ and ‘anxiety’ are improperly used as synonymous expressions; they are in fact capable of clear distinction in relation to their danger. ‘Anxiety’ describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one. ‘Fear’ requires a definite object of which to be afraid. ‘Fright’, however, is the name we give to the state a person gets into when he has run into danger without being prepared for it” (Freud <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</i> p. 12). The spider is an excellent example of Freud’s definitions of fear and anxiety.</p>

<p>In this first encounter with the spider, only the legs are visible, but the player can already tell that this obstacle is different from the others they have previously encountered. The light shines brightly on the legs, highlighting the contrast between their dark shape and the foggy background. The legs point at the player and seek them out, clearly indicating that they are not moving aimlessly. The spider foreshadows the dark and dangerous world ahead.</p>
